# Day 1: Monday 5, Oct 2020 6:30-7:30pm
Created and filled out the Motivations file, with planning and estimates for the
structure of the rest of the project. Set up project directory, and discussed
the project with another developer.

## Note for Tomorrow
Create a git repository, and work on extending the documentation of the
subsystems. Decided on a language and a debugger, and create documentation
relating to the development environment you've selected. Restructure the
documentation directory to allow for enhanced scalability.

# Day 2: Tuesday 6, Oct 2020 3:00-4:00pm
Created and configured a git repository, and linked it to GitHub. Began work on
the specification of the language. Worked on directory structure. Chose Python

## Note for Tomorrow
Extend language specification documents, extend general specifications for the
planning of ZelSystem.

# Day 3: Wednesday 7, Oct 2020 5:30-6:30pm
