# Day 1: Monday 12, Oct 2020 9:00-10:00pm
Filled out more of the Language Specifications, and reworked the ZLang modelling
section. Worked on the implementation model, and set out plans for eventual
implementation of ZLang via enabling primitives.

## Note for Tomorrow
Extend the modelling and specification sections. Try to have a Python file by
the end of the week.

# Day 2: Tuesday 13, Oct 2020 6:00-7:00pm
Extended Language Specification, and addeed the file for implementation
guidelines. The micro-ZL language is partially specified and the basic
evaluation loop is defined. The module structure of the Python implementation
was added as well.

## Note for Tomorrow
Set up of the source files as described in the Implementation guide. Start a
user manual file in the documentation.

# Day 3: Wednesday 14, Oct 2020 N/A
No work done

# Day 4: Thursday 15, Oct 2020 5:00-6:00pm
Extended language modelling, and implementation guidelines, and finally broke
ground on actual code-writing. Updated the Makefile, and fixed an extension
error.

# Day 5: Friday 16, Oct 2020 3:00-4:00pm
Wrote the skeletons of the Python model, and laid down some testing strings.
Worked on file IO and some extended documentation for implementation patterns.
