# Day 1: Monday 12, Oct 2020 9:00-10:00pm
Filled out more of the Language Specifications, and reworked the ZLang modelling
section. Worked on the implementation model, and set out plans for eventual
implementation of ZLang via enabling primitives.

## Note for Tomorrow
Extend the modelling and specification sections. Try to have a Python file by
the end of the week.
