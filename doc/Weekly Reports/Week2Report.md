# Day 1: Monday 19, Oct 2020 5:00-6:00pm
Laid down groundwork for the Python implementation for microZL,got a working car
and cdr function, working on interleaving the runtime and the evironment

# Day 2: Tuesday 20, Oct 2020 11:00-12:00pm
Ran into the first issue. Both the car and cdr functions have serious pathologies
and needs intense testing and fixing. Tomorrow the plan is to set up a testing
rig and produce a working car.

# Day 3: Wednesday 21, Oct 2020 7:00-8:00pm
Chose a standard framework for list processing. Construction of a
"string-to-list" function is critical for continual development. Primitives
are under full develop.

# Day 4: Thursday 22, Oct 2020 9:30-10:30pm
Implemented additional Python primitives, set up the skeletons of the primitives
file. Again, it is highly critical to set up a list parser for the ZLang input
